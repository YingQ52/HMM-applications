# HMM-applications
## 1. Using Hidden Markov Model to identify DNA replication timing variation regions
  - Used Continuous Density Hidden Markov Model to predict regions with high variations of DNA replication timing
  - Combined forward and backward algorithm with EM algorithm to train parameters in HMM 
  - used Mix Gaussian model to estimate continuous observation density
## 2. Using Gibbs sampling in a Markov chain Monte Carlo approach to find motifs from sequence data
